ASDDS (Automated Apnea Sleep Disorder Detection System) uses sensor technologies and machine learning to accurately detect and classify sleep apnea events. It offers a noninvasive, cost-effective solution with real-time results, high sensitivity, and specificity, making it ideal for enhancing sleep health management.

# Introduction:
Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by recurring interruptions in breathing during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks. Timely and accurate diagnosis of sleep apnea is crucial for effective management and prevention of associated complications. Currently, the diagnosis involves labor-intensive and costly manual sleep studies conducted in sleep clinics, often leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation.
# Design Thinking Process:
Our team applied a design thinking process to guide the project. The process included five stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. We empathized with sleep apnea specialists, defined the problem of apnea sleep disorder detection, generated ideas for predictive models, developed prototypes using deep learning algorithms, IOT sensors for data abstraction, interface for the user, and tested the models for accuracy. As a primary Research, we Engaged with a sleep apnea specialist named Harini, a World Sleep Society certified international sleep disorders specialist . We asked a few
questions like,
1. What is sleep Apnea disorder?
2. On What Basis, this disorder is estimated?
3. what are the primary things that are essential to measure sleep apnea?
4. What are the reasons for these diseases among us?

Then we went through our Secondary Research by Validating our Problem Statement with existing technologies or relevant technologies. The Conclusions we made are:
• We identified several technologies utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms for sleep apnea detection. These technologies leverage various physiological signals, such as airflow, blood oxygen levels, and heart rate, to accurately identify and classify sleep apnea events. 
• Our research demonstrated that machine learning algorithms, including deep learning and pattern recognition techniques, have shown promising results in accurately detecting sleep apnea events and differentiating between obstructive and central types.
# In our Ideation Phase, We are coming up with the technologies that we can provide to Sleep specialist:
• We identified several technologies utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms for sleep apnea detection.
• These technologies leverage various physiological signals, such as airflow, blood oxygen levels, and heart rate, to accurately identify and classify sleep apnea events.
• We can develop a website in which we give all the information regarding the importance of sleep and also it enhances the awareness among the people.
• Apnea sleep disorder is evaluated by machine learning algorithms and is displayed with the help of an interface and also take the help of sensors for some data of the user to evaluate.
• Signal Processing plays a crucial role in extracting the data for evaluation purposes.
